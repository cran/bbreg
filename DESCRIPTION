Description: Functions to fit, via Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the Bessel and Beta regressions to a data set with a bounded continuous response variable. The Bessel regression is a new and robust approach proposed in the literature. The EM version for the well known Beta regression is another major contribution of this package. See the reference Barreto-Souza, Mayrink and Simas (2020) <arXiv:2003.05157> for details.
