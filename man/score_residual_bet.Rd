\usage{
score_residual_bet(kap, lam, z, x, v, nsim_score = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{kap}{coefficients in kappa related to the mean parameter.}

\item{lam}{coefficients in lambda related to the precision parameter.}

\item{z}{response vector with 0 < z[i] < 1.}

\item{x}{matrix containing the covariates for the mean submodel. Each column is a different covariate.}

\item{v}{matrix containing the covariates for the precision submodel. Each column is a different covariate.}

\item{nsim_score}{number synthetic data sets (default = 100) to be generated as a support to estime the mean and s.d. of log(z)-log(1-z).}
}
\value{
Vector containing the score residuals.
}
\description{
Function to calculate empirical score residuals based on the bessel regression.
